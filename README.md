# Odin-Calculator

- A simple calculator built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, designed to perform basic arithmetic operations.

- This project was developed as part of my learning path, focusing on DOM manipulation, event handling, and object-based operations without using external libraries or frameworks

- Features: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage.


# Features

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and percentage.

- Operations handled through JavaScript objects for better readability and scalability.
